The point of this project is to create a base
for reading game engine op codes, allowing you
to read, edit and save the scripts.

The main intent of this tool was
to be used as a translation tool

Goals:

-Simple Op definitions
make it simple to enter user defined opcodes in a text file

-Calculate jump opcodes
allow the user to edit lines of codes freely,
such as extending dialogue without breaking jump points.
